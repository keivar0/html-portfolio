<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Keivar Calderon. This is officially my first ever website, to be rendered on the world wide 
  web. I have always wanted to learn programming and today that is coming true. I have gone through a series of trial 
  and error, looking at Youtube videos to help expand my knowledge on the topic, but I never stuck with it. The reason 
  being, because I am a person who needs structure, in order to learn something. Thanks to Angela Yu, my goal on learning
  full stack web development is coming to life. Enough about my desire to learn programming let me tell you about who I am.
</p>

<p>I come from a Mexican background, born in Los Angeles, California. I am 20 years of age and currently attend California 
  State University, Northridge. I am receiving my Bachelors degree in Political Science, and yes I know you are probably 
  wondering, "Why am I not in computer Science? or in that environment?" I had enlisted as a Comp Sci major but I was 
  brand new and much was already expected of me, when I knew nothing about coding. I gave up and put that desire away 
  at the beginning of my freshman year, in college. Now, today, somewhere in the end of July, 2024 I opened that casket up 
  again. I often find myself not doing anything so it was in my best interest to seek knowledge in the world of programming. 
  Aside from all that you hear about programmers making a good living, the technicality and creatitivity is what caught 
  my interst. I am not sure what life has in store for me but I seek to prioritize my own self interest, rather to live 
  the life that every typical college movie portrays. Bring up the topic of finances, I want to touch up a little more on 
  that. My family does not come from money and I have high aspirations to one day retire my parents. I know this is no 
  easy task, however, I am determined to do so, through the  grace of God. Normally, people identify with certain things
  of this world, which is quite decieving. That's why I put my faith in my Lord and savior Jesus Christ. 
</p>

<p>I bring up Jesus Christ because this world is being tormented by evil forces that we choose to ignore as a society. 
  Some people believe that life is a mistake but the logic behind that is very suceptable not because it is a mistake but because
  if you choose to believe that there is no God, you are free to do whatever you want. In the world of programming, that
  is not the case. It is reqired for you to know the rules and to abide by them. Otherwise, your code will not run. 
  I know some of you will go out and say, "but I am a good person and I don't believe in God." Well, if you are a good 
  person today, what is to stop you from being but a bad person tomorrow?, nothing is stopping you. To all programmers 
  and to whoever reads this, notice that in life there are many struggles, which often cause worry. If you choose God 
  and let him take over, life will not become easier but you will see the grace and love that he has for you. I hope 
  that you choose God and the not the world, because people often fail but God never does.
